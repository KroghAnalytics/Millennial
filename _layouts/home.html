<H1> KROGH ANALYTICS </H1> 


<H6> Analysing the World </H6>

<p>
Hi, my name is Morten Krogh, this is my personal webpage.
</p>

<p> 
I am Master student in Quantitative Economics at the University of Aarhus. On this webpage I will share some of things I am working upon at the University and also sparetime projects. 
</p>

​

<p> You might wonder why I am building this site, this is simply due to the fact that I am very passionate about my study as well as developing nice graphs of my analysis to improve procurement of complicated information and analysis to layman. </p>

​

<p> Hope you will enjoy my webpage, otherwise leave a comment for improvements. Thank You! </p>
