Hi, my name is Morten Krogh, this is my personal webpage.

​

I am Master student in Quantitative Economics at the University of Aarhus. On this webpage I will share some of things I am working upon at the University and also sparetime projects. 

​

You might wonder why I am building this site, this is simply due to the fact that I am very passionate about my study as well as developing nice graphs of my analysis to improve procurement of complicated information and analysis to layman. 

​

Hope you will enjoy my webpage, otherwise leave a comment for improvements. Thank You! </p>
